This soccer database, sourced from Kaggle, contains comprehensive data for soccer matches, players, and teams across several European countries from 2008 to 2016. The dataset is extensive, featuring over 25,000 matches and 10,000 players from 11 European countries, focusing on their top championships for the 2008 to 2016 seasons. Players' and teams' attributes are derived from EA Sports' FIFA video game series, including weekly updates. It includes team lineups with squad formations (X, Y coordinates), betting odds from up to 10 providers, and detailed match events (such as goal types, possession, corners, crosses, fouls, and cards) for over 10,000 matches. Utilizing this dataset, I aim to generate intriguing insights, combining my passion for football and SQL.
